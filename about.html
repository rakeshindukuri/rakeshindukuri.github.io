    <h1>Hi, I'm Rakesh Indukuri!</h1>
    <p>A passionate and enthusiastic Bioinformatics Grad student, primarily interested in Data, analysis, and algorithms in Bioinformatics, got fascinated by the power and capability of AI/ ML and want to work on projects in various domains of this cutting-edge field. I am eager to learn new tech and work on innovative projects in Bioinformatics.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I have an avid passion for Biology and Computer Science, two things that interest me, excite me, and make me quench to learn more about. I am also keen on new tech, innovation (attracts me a lot!). I often get referred to as a quick learner, and a guy with an unparalleled perception towards problems and things. I have performed reliably well in scholastics, and I have sound knowledge in Mathematics, Biology, and Computer Science. I have been awarded as a top-achieving student at my school. This assiduous nature has carried over to my Undergraduate, where I scored a CGPA of 9.72 on the scale of 10.00.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I lived in a dilemma where I was trapped between two different worlds - Biology and Computer science, and I couldn't figure out my true calling. Because, on the one hand, I was passionate about studying living organisms, healthcare and the betterment of daily life. But on the other hand, the technological revolution and the innovation it offered caught me off-guard. I am amazed by how much impact Biology and Computer science put on our daily lives. This perplexed me, as I did not know what to focus more on. Fortunately, I found my answer at the intersection of the two fields as Bioinformatics. As an enthusiast, the field of Bioinformatics has always appealed to my intellect and creativity. I am good at managing things and events as I've organized and volunteered in several international & national conferences, seminars, and workshops. I have exceptional zeal towards bioinformatics & I'm looking forward to "Win at whatever I am doing". This is what drives me.</p>
